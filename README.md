# ReflectionLibrary

 reflection not because of using assembly reflection but because this repo can be reflected upon in the future for a bit of a reminder.

The reflection library is a collection of example code of design patterns,
namely the 23 design patterns from the book [design patterns: elements of reusable object-oriented software 1994].

The folder structure of this project resembles the domain of the patterns.
Each pattern domain has a demo class that provides some output to the console.
